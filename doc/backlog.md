# Project Backlog

## Done âœ…

### Core Library
- Convert Android.mk to CMakeLists.txt
- Add missing C++ libraries (LZO, JNI)
- Adapt C++ code for Linux environment
- Set up Docker build environment with Amazon Linux 2
- Implement Java test program
- Verify JNI integration

### Build System
- Create Dockerfile for Amazon Linux 2
- Set up docker-compose for development
- Configure CMake build system
- Add Lambda build configuration
- Create build automation script

## In Progress ðŸ”„

### CGO Support
    Implement a C++ wrapper for the CGO bindings to expose core functionality to Go.
    The interface exposed to Go should be the same as the JNI interface.
    Update build.sh so it builds both the JNI and CGO wrappers.
    The CGO wrapper should have it's own folder and CMakeLists.txt and depends on `cb2pgnlib`.
